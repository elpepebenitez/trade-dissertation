We present the results of our extended models allowing us to capture the
differentiated effects of TAs on bilateral exports depending on whether
the country pair are two ``North'' countries (NN), a ``North'' and a
``South'' country (NS), or two ``South'' countries (SS).

The results of the extended benchmark estimation by region, contained in
Table 2 again show heterogenous results across regions. It is
interesting to note that by disaggregating the TA effects, in the case
of Americas and Europe, both of which had significant and positive
coefficients in the benchmark estimation, now again have significant and
positive coefficients for both NS TA + Lag and SS TA + Lag , but the
effects are larger in both cases for the SS TA + Lag coefficient. Asia
now has a slightly significant and negative coefficient for NS TA + Lag
while the coefficient for SS TA + Lag remains not significant.
Intercontinental have significant and positive effects of NS Lag and SS
Lag, but NS TA + Lag and SS TA + Lag are both not significant now.
Africa's coefficients remain not significant, and it is the only region
with only South-South TAs.
