In contrast with our main interest of research, which are the potential
heterogenous effects of PTAs on different members for different types of
agreements, this benchmark model, specifically
\(\beta = \beta_{1} + \beta_{2}\) , would provide the average ``total''
partial effect of PTAs on trade after accounting for lagged effects, but
it cannot provide the effects for a given agreement. As such, an
expansion can be implemented to capture heterogeneity in PTA effects as
proposed by Baier \emph{et al}. (Baier, Yotov, and Zylkin 2019):

% \[(2)\ \ \ \ \ X_{ij,t} = \ exp(\eta_{i,t} + \psi_{j,t} + \gamma_{\binom{-}{ij}} + \sum_{A}^{}{\beta_{1,A}{PTA}_{ij,t}} + \sum_{A}^{}{\beta_{2,A}{PTA}_{ij,t - 5}} + \sum_{t}^{}b_{t}) + \epsilon_{ij,t}\]
\begin{multline}
    X_{ij,t} = \exp\left(\eta_{i,t} + \psi_{j,t} + \gamma_{\binom{-}{ij}} + \sum_{A} \beta_{1,A} \, PTA_{ij,t} \right. + \sum_{A} \beta_{2,A} \, PTA_{ij,t-5} + \left. \sum_{t} b_{t} \right) + \epsilon_{ij,t}
\end{multline}

Equation (2) can be implemented to account for heterogeneous effects of
PTAs at the level of the specific agreement, by allowing for distinct
average partial effects for each individual agreement, using superscript
\(A\) to index by agreement and also allowing for agreement-specific
lags: \(\beta_{A} = \beta_{1,A} + \beta_{2,A}\).
