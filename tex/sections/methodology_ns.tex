In order to analyse the differentiated effects of North-North,
North-South and South-South TAs, we extend both models to get estimates
for each type of TA. Our benchmark model is extended as follows:

\begin{multline}
    X_{ij,t} = \exp\left(\eta_{i,t} + \psi_{j,t} + \gamma_{\binom{-}{ij}} + \beta_{1NN} \, TA\_NN_{ij,t} + \beta_{2NN} \, TA\_NN_{ij,t-5} \right. \\
    + \beta_{1NS} \, TA\_NS_{ij,t} + \beta_{2NS} \, TA\_NS_{ij,t-5} + \beta_{1SS} \, TA\_SS_{ij,t} + \beta_{2SS} \, TA\_SS_{ij,t-5} \\
    + \left. \sum_{t} b_{t} \right) + \epsilon_{ij,t}
\end{multline}

Where \(X_{ij,t}\)\hspace{0pt} denotes the value of exports from country
\(i\) to country \(j\) at time \(t\); \(\eta_{i,t}\) and
\(\psi_{j,t}\ \)are exporter-time and importer-time fixed effects,
respectively; \(\gamma_{\binom{-}{ij}}\) is a country-pair fixed effect;
\hspace{0pt}\(\beta_{1NN}\) and \(\beta_{2NN}\) are the coefficients for
the immediate and lagged effects of a North-North TA (\(TA\_ NN\));
\hspace{0pt}\hspace{0pt}\(\beta_{1NS}\) and \(\beta_{2NS}\) are the
coefficients for the immediate and lagged effects of a North-South TA
(\(TA\_ SN\)); \hspace{0pt}\hspace{0pt}\(\beta_{1SS}\) and
\(\beta_{2SS}\) are the coefficients for the immediate and lagged
effects of a South-South TA (\(TA\_ SS\)); \(\sum_{t}^{}b_{t}\) is a set
of time dummies accounting for international trade-specific effects at
each time \(t\); and \(\epsilon_{ij,t}\) is the error term.

Equation (2) also gets extended to capture the heterogeneous effects of
the different types of TAs as follows:

\begin{multline}
    X_{ij,t} = \exp\left(\eta_{i,t} + \psi_{j,t} + \gamma_{\binom{-}{ij}} + \sum_{A}\left(\beta_{1,A,NN} \, TA\_NN_{ij,t} + \beta_{2,A,NN} \, TA\_NN_{ij,t-5}\right) \right. \\
    + \sum_{A}\left(\beta_{1,A,NS} \, TA\_NS_{ij,t} + \beta_{2,A,NS} \, TA\_NS_{ij,t-5}\right) + \sum_{A}\left(\beta_{1,A,SS} \, TA\_SS_{ij,t} + \beta_{2,A,SS} \, TA\_SS_{ij,t-5}\right) \\
    + \left. \sum_{t} b_{t} \right) + \epsilon_{ij,t}
\end{multline}

Where \(X_{ij,t}\)\hspace{0pt} denotes the value of exports from country
\(i\) to country \(j\) at time \(t\); \(\eta_{i,t}\) and
\(\psi_{j,t}\ \)are exporter-time and importer-time fixed effects,
respectively; \(\gamma_{\binom{-}{ij}}\) is a country-pair fixed effect;
The summations \hspace{0pt}\(\sum_{}^{}A\) denote the sum over different
agreements \(A\) for: \(\beta_{1,A,NN}\) and \(\beta_{2,A,NN}\):
Coefficients for the immediate and lagged effects of North-North TAs
\hspace{0pt}(\(TA\_ NN\)); \(\beta_{1,A,NS}\) and \(\beta_{2,A,NS}\):
Coefficients for the immediate and lagged effects of North-South TAs
(\(TA\_ SN\)); \(\beta_{1,A,SS}\) and \(\beta_{2,A,SS}\): Coefficients
for the immediate and lagged effects of South-South TAs (\(TA\_ SS\));
\(\sum_{t}^{}b_{t}\) is a set of time dummies accounting for
trade-specific effects at each time \(t\); and \(\epsilon_{ij,t}\) is
the error term.

For both extended models we use the following variables:
\({TA\_ NN}_{ij,t}\) is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if
the trade pair \((i,j)\) is North-North and part of a TA at time \(t\),
and 0 otherwise; \({TA\_ NN}_{ij,t - 5}\) is a dummy variable that takes
the value of 1 if the trade pair \((i,j)\) is North-North and was part
of a TA at time \(t\)\emph{-5}, and 0 otherwise; \({TA\_ NS}_{ij,t}\) is
a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the trade pair \((i,j)\)
is North-South and part of a TA at time \(t\), and 0 otherwise;
\({TA\_ NS}_{ij,t - 5}\) is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1
if the trade pair \((i,j)\) is North-South and was part of a TA at time
\(t\)\emph{-5}, and 0 otherwise; \({TA\_ SS}_{ij,t}\) is a dummy
variable that takes the value of 1 if the trade pair \((i,j)\) is
South-South and part of a TA at time \(t\), and 0 otherwise;
\({TA\_ SS}_{ij,t - 5}\) is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1
if the trade pair \((i,j)\) is South-South and was part of a TA at time
\(t\)\emph{-5}, and 0 otherwise;

The extended models allow us to capture the differentiated effects of
TAs on bilateral exports depending on whether the pair country are two
``North'' countries (NN), a ``North'' and a ``South'' country (NS), or
two ``South'' countries (SS).
