The proliferation of Trade Agreements (TAs) since the early 1990s has
been well documented in the international trade academic literature
(\cite{dahi_preferential_2013} Dahi \& Demir, 2013; \cite{mayda_south-south_2007} Mayda \& Steinberg, 2007). This trend has slowed
down since the 1990s but is has not stopped. Table1 shows the historical
evolution of TAs, showing the dramatic increase in the 1990s.
