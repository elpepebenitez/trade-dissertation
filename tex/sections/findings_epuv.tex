Finally, we present the results of running our estimations substituting
trade flows as our dependent variable for the unit values of products
exported, specifically under the HS 2-digit codes 84 and 85 for
manufacturing products, in order to analyse if the effect of TAs goes
beyond trade volumes. For ease of comparison, we ran each estimation
twice for each HS code: one with trade volume as the dependent variable,
and one with the unit value of the product exported as the dependent
variable.

Tables 4 and 5, and 6 and 7, show the results of our benchmark model for
each region for trade volumes and the unit value of the product
exported, and for HS 84 and 85, respectively. We continue to observe
heterogeneous results across regions. In table 3, for the trade volume
of HS 84, none of the TA + Lag coefficients are statistically
significant with the exception of the Intercontinental region, for which
it is statistically significant and negative. In table 4, for the unit
value of the product exported of HS 84, the effects are not significant
for Africa and Asia, they are significant and negative for Americas, and
significant and positive for Europe and Intercontinental. Interestingly,
these results suggest that Intercontinental TAs reduced the volume of
trade of HS 84 products but increased the value per unit. In table 5,
for the trade volume of HS 85, TA + Lag coefficients are not
statistically significant for Americas, Asia and Intercontinental, while
Africa's results are significant and positive, and Europe's are
significant and negative. In table 6, for the unit value of the product
exported of HS 85, results are only slightly significant for
Intercontinental, with a negative coefficient. The rest of the regions
do not have significant results.

Tables 7 and 8, and 9 and 10, show the results of our extended benchmark
model with North-North, North-South and South-South TAs, for each region
for trade volumes and the unit value of the product exported, and for HS
84 and 85, respectively. In table 7, for the trade volume of HS 84, we
observe that for North-North trade, TA + Lag coefficient for
Intercontinental has a significant and positive coefficient, while
Europe's is not significant. For North-South trade TA + Lag coefficients
are not significant for Asia and Europe, while they are significant and
positive for Americas, and significant and negative for
Intercontinental. For South-South trade, TA + Lag for Africa, Asia and
Europe do not have significant coefficients, while the coefficients of
Americas and Intercontinental are significant and negative. In table 8,
for the unit value of the product exported of HS 84, for North-North
trade's TA + Lag, Europe's coefficient is significant and positive and
the coefficient of Intercontinental is not significant. For North-South
trade, none of the TA + Lag coefficients are significant. For
South-South trade, the TA + Lag coefficients of Africa, Americas and
Asia are not significant, while Europe and Intercontinental have
significant and positive coefficients. Interestingly, while trade volume
for North-South and South-South for Intercontinental TAs decreased, the
value per unit of South-South trade increased. In table 9, for the trade
volume of HS 85, we observe that for North-North trade, TA + Lag
coefficient for Intercontinental has a significant and positive
coefficient, while Europe's is not significant. For North-South trade TA
+ Lag coefficients are not significant for Americas, Asia and
Intercontinental, while they are significant and negative for Europe.
For South-South trade, TA + Lag for Americas, Asia, Europe and
Intercontinental do not have significant coefficients, while the
coefficient of Africa is significant and positive. In table 10, for the
unit value of the product exported of HS 85, for North-North trade's TA
+ Lag, Europe and Intercontinental coefficients are not significant. For
North-South trade, the TA + Lag coefficients for Americas and Europe are
not significant, while they are significant and negative for Asia and
Intercontinental. For South-South trade, the TA + Lag coefficients of
Africa, Americas and Intercontinental are not significant, while Europe
has significant and negative coefficients and Asia has significant and
positive coefficients. Interestingly, for Asia's exports, the value per
unit of product exported decreased with North-South trade but increased
with South-South trade.

Finally, for illustrative purposed, in tables 11 and 12, and 13 and 14,
we include the estimates of our model allowing for TA specific effects,
extended with North-North, North-South and South-South TAs, for Africa
and Americas, for trade volumes and the unit value of the product
exported, and for HS 84 and 85, respectively. In table 11, for the trade
volumes of HS 84 and 85 for Africa, which only has South-South TAs, we
can see that TA 670 had statistically significant and negative effects
on the trade volume of HS 84, and not significant for HS 85. TA 787 did
not have a significant impact on trade volume of HS 84, while it has
significant and positive effects on HS 85. In table 12, for the unit
value of products HS 84 and 85 exported for the region of Africa, we can
see that TA 670 did not have significant effects on the value per unit
of products in HS 84 and 85. TA 787 did not have a significant impact on
the value per unit of HS 84, while it has significant and positive
effects on HS 85. This is a case where we can see a that a TA has a
significant effect on the volume of trade and in the value per unit of a
category of manufacturing products of a South-South trade relationship.

In table 13, for the trade volumes of HS 84 and 85, and table 14 for the
unit value of products HS 84 and 85, all for the region of Americas,
which has North-South and South-South TAs, we can observe heterogeneous
effects of different TAs on the different types of bilateral trade
relationships. One interesting example is TA 188, which has North-South
and South-South trade among its members. It has positive and significant
effects in the trade volumes of HS 84 and 85 for South-South trade,
while it has no significant effect in the trade volume of HS 84 and 85
for North-South trade. Furthermore, it has a significant and negative
effects on the value per unit of HS 84 for both North-South and
South-South trade, and it has no significant effect on the value per
unit of HS 85 for both North-South and South-South trade.
