	abstract = {We conduct a randomized experiment that generates exogenous variation in the access to foreign markets for rug producers in Egypt. Combined with detailed survey data, we causally identify the impact of exporting on firm performance. Treatment firms report 16–26\% higher profits and exhibit large improvements in quality alongside reductions in output per hour relative to control firms. These findings do not simply reflect firms being offered higher margins to manufacture high-quality products that take longer to produce. Instead, we find evidence of learning-by-exporting whereby exporting improves technical efficiency. First, treatment firms have higher productivity and quality after controlling for rug specifications. Second, when asked to produce an identical domestic rug using the same inputs and same capital equipment, treatment firms produce higher quality rugs despite no difference in production time. Third, treatment firms exhibit learning curves over time. Finally, we document knowledge transfers with quality increasing most along the specific dimensions that the knowledge pertained to.},

A seller's reputation is defined by buyer's beliefs about seller's reliability. We show that (i) due to lack of enforcement, the volume of trade is constrained by the value of the relationship; (ii) the value of the relationship increases with the age of the relationship; and (iii) during an exogenous negative supply shock deliveries are an inverted-U shaped function of relationship's age. Models exclusively focusing on enforcement or insurance considerations cannot account for the evidence. ({JEL} D86, F14, L14, O13, O19, Q17)},

Event study estimates reveal that domestic firms experience strong and persistent gains in performance after supplying to a first {MNC} buyer. Four years after, domestic firms employ 26\% more workers and have a 4\% to 9\% higher total factor productivity ({TFP}). These effects are unlikely to be explained by demand effects or changes in tax compliance. Moreover, suppliers experience a large drop in their sales to all other buyers except the first {MNC} buyer in the year of the event, followed by a gradual recovery. The dynamics of adjustment in sales to others suggests that firms face short-run capacity constraints that relax over time. Four years later, the sales to others grow by 20\%. Most of this growth comes from the acquisition of new buyers, which tend to be “better buyers” (e.g., larger and with more stable supplier relationships). Finally, we collected survey data from domestic firms and {MNCs} to provide further insights into the wide-ranging benefits of supplying to {MNCs}. According to our surveys, these benefits range from better managerial practices to a better reputation.},

Treated and untreated districts have similar trends in {TFP} prior to the opening of the large greenfield foreign plant. Over the four years starting with the year of the opening, {TFP} of domestic plants is 8\% higher in treated districts. Using an alternative identification strategy that exploits the assignment of land for {FDI} by the Ethiopian Government, we obtain similar results. Foreign plants also attract new economic activity to treated districts. Exposure to foreign firms enhances domestic firms’: (i) production processes; (ii) managerial and organizational practices; (iii) logistics and; (iv) knowledge about exporting. Knowledge transfer is more likely among labor or vertically linked firms but also occurs outside these channels.},

In the twenty-five years since Rodríguez and Rodrik's (2000) critical survey of empirical work on this question, new research has tried to overcome the various methodological problems that have plagued previous attempts to provide a convincing answer. I examine three strands of recent work on this issue: cross-country regressions focusing on within-country growth, synthetic control methods on specific reform episodes, and empirical country studies looking at the channels through which lower trade barriers may increase productivity. A consistent finding is that trade reforms have had a positive impact on economic growth, on average, although the effect is heterogeneous across countries. Overall, these research findings should temper some of the previous agnosticism about the empirical link between trade reform and economic performance.},

To help form an evidence-based opinion, I review in this paper the theoretical and empirical literature on the relationship between globalization and wage inequality. While the initial analysis that started in the early 1990s focused on a particular mechanism that links trade to wages, subsequent studies have considered several other channels, and the quantitative assessment of the size of these influences has been carried out in multiple studies. Building on this research, I conclude that trade played an appreciable role in increasing wage inequality, but that its cumulative effect has been modest, and that globalization does not explain the preponderance of the rise in wage inequality within countries.},

On the other hand it increases competition as more firms enter the export market. This in turn reduces profits and therefore innovation incentives particularly for firms with low productivity. Overall the positive impact of the export shock on innovation is magnified for high productivity firms, whereas it may negatively affect innovation in low productivity firms. We test this prediction with patent, customs and production data covering all French manufacturing firms. To address potential endogeneity issues, we construct firm-level export proxies which respond to aggregate conditions in a firm's export destinations but are exogenous to firm-level decisions. We show that patenting robustly increases more with export demand for initially more productive firms. This effect is reversed forthe least productive firms as the negative competition effect dominates.},

In developed countries, export opportunities and access to imported intermediates tend to encourage innovation, but the evidence on import competition is mixed, especially for firms in the United States.

The paper offers explanations for the sign switch by controlling for novel measures of the changing world economic environment. Rejecting alternative explanations based on changing export market growth or transportation cost declines, it shows how the modern negative correlation could be reversed in a world environment characterized by a moderately higher generalized tariff protection such as that which prevailed before 1914. We show that an increase in average tariff rates among trading partners by just one third might suffice to reverse any negative relationship between an average country's tariffs and its growth. An increase in own tariffs after 1950 hurt or at least didn't help growth, but it might have helped growth in a world where average trading partners' tariffs were moderately higher and retaliation was the best strategy. The world environment matters. Leader-country reaction to big world events matters.},

The impact of tariff changes on regional earnings 20 years after liberalization was three times the effect after 10 years. These increasing effects on regional earnings are inconsistent with conventional spatial equilibrium models, which predict declining effects due to spatial arbitrage. We investigate potential mechanisms, finding empirical support for a mechanism involving imperfect interregional labor mobility and dynamics in labor demand, driven by slow capital adjustment and agglomeration economies. This mechanism gradually amplifies the effects of liberalization, explaining the slow adjustment path of regional earnings and quantitatively accounting for the magnitude of the long-run effects.},

With Bad Samaritans, this provocative scholar bursts into the debate on globalization and economic justice. Using irreverent wit, an engagingly personal style, and a battery of examples, Chang blasts holes in the "World Is Flat" orthodoxy of Thomas Friedman and other liberal economists who argue that only unfettered capitalism and wide-open international trade can lift struggling nations out of poverty. On the contrary, Chang shows, today's economic superpowers-from the U.S. to Britain to his native Korea-all attained prosperity by shameless protectionism and government intervention in industry. We have conveniently forgotten this fact, telling ourselves a fairy tale about the magic of free trade and-via our proxies such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization-ramming policies that suit ourselves down the throat of the developing world.  Unlike typical economists who construct models of how the marketplace should work, Chang examines the past: what has actually happened. His pungently contrarian history demolishes one pillar after another of free-market mythology. We treat patents and copyrights as sacrosanct-but developed our own industries by studiously copying others' technologies. We insist that centrally planned economies stifle growth-but many developing countries had higher {GDP} growth before they were pressured into deregulating their economies. Both justice and common sense, Chang argues, demand that we reevaluate the policies we force on nations that are struggling to follow in our footsteps.},

Statistical analysis demonstrates that sectors with these characteristics were more likely to lobby for free trade in North America; these sectors were also exposed to free trade more rapidly under the tariff-phasing schedule in the {NAFTA} treaty. However, corporate restructuring to rescale production for the regional market and to increase offshore assembly presented adjustment costs for U.S. workers, which created divisions between labor unions and their employers. I conclude that regional arrangements are an attractive mechanism to liberalize trade for firms in need of larger-than-national markets to take advantage of economies of scale or to develop production-sharing networks.},

The decision, highly contested domestically, represents a sea change in Japanese trade policy and a challenging case for theories of regionalism. This paper lays out a theoretical appraisal for why more and more industrialized countries join {FTAs} with emerging markets and illustrates the argument with an analysis of the Japanese case. The paper argues that foreign direct investment ({FDI}) changes the incentives for states in favour of preferential trade agreements. Increased {FDI} and shifts in multinational firm strategies increase flows of intermediate goods. As a result, firms lobby their home governments to bolster their competitive position by signing preferential agreements. Yet, {FTAs} also discriminate against firms from third parties, motivating them to lobby for defensive agreements. The qualitative case studies show how {NAFTA} discriminates against Japanese {FDI} in Mexico. As a result, firms began to lobby the Japanese trade bureaucracy, changing the perception of key policymakers who developed a strategy of pursuing preferential trade agreements in the Asia Pacific region, as shown in a case study of the initiative for an {FTA} with Thailand.},

Most developing countries benefit from the generalized system of preferences ({GSP}) and related schemes when they export to the United States, the {EU}, and other developed economies. And yet, many pursue fully reciprocal agreements that require major concessions to the developed partner. We argue that this is due to the nature of the {GSP} as a unilateral concession that can be (and often is) taken away. High dependence on unilateral, removable preferences generates "political trade dependence" ({PTD}). We distinguish {PTD} from standard measures of trade dependence, and we explain why {PTD} motivates developing countries to seek North—South Regional Trade Agreements ({RTAs}). We show the effects of {PTD} with a selection of illustrative cases and test our hypothesis on a data set of {EU} and {US} trade agreements with developing countries. We find robust statistical support for our hypothesis that high and rising levels of {PTD} make the negotiation of a North—South {RTA} more likely.},

In addition to reducing barriers at the border, modern {PTAs} remove many behind-the-border barriers by regulating foreign direct investment ({FDI}), liberalizing services, and protecting intellectual property rights. This article surveys the literature explaining the formation of {PTAs} and their consequences. Regarding the formation of {PTAs}, studies have gradually moved from exploring the macro-foundation of preferential liberalization to focusing on the micro-foundation of {PTAs}, relying on industry- and firm-level data. Regarding the effect of {PTAs}, there is robust evidence that {PTAs} substantively increase trade flows and {FDI} and are associated with economic reforms in developing countries, though the general welfare effect of preferential liberalization remains largely unexplored. I make some concrete suggestions on avenues toward which to push the research on {PTAs}. In particular, I argue that scholars interested in {PTAs} would benefit from engaging in debate about the distributional consequences of trade liberalization, which not only informs much of the current academic and policy research but also features in political debates taking place in democratic polities.},

Yet as the economic distance between negotiating partners widens, the likelihood that changes in trade flows will affect the economic structure of the less developed partner increase. This paper explores the components of two prominent highly asymmetric negotiations – the Dominican Republic – Central America Free Trade Agreement and the European Union – Caribbean Forum Economic Partnership Agreement – to assess the channels through which the resulting organisation of trade may impact the vulnerability profile of the developing country partners. We find that these {FTAs} have the potential to address economic vulnerability in the developing country partners in ways that would not be possible in their absence.},

A more nuanced view expects states to seek the benefits of multilateralism whilst finding convenient loopholes and escape routes from its policy constraints. This paper steers a different course, focusing on the overt ('legitimate') measures industrialized states are undertaking to succeed in the international arena. Rich nations as a group have carved out a multilateral order which best suits their current development trajectory - one that diminishes space for promoting industries critical to their climb up the development ladder, while increasing scope for sponsoring the technology-intensive sectors now critical to securing national prosperity. State activism continues and in some respects has taken on a more strategic and collaborative quality. This paper discusses several forms of 'strategic activism' in trade, technology, and finance and considers why it has emerged in the context of increased multilateral discipline.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the developmental trade-offs involved in multilateral versus regional-bilateral strategies of integration into the international economy. I contrast the regulations that guide policy in the areas of trade, investment, and intellectual property in the World Trade Organization ({WTO}) and in regional-bilateral agreements between the {US} and developing countries. Both strategies of integration feature similar trade-offs, in that developing countries gain increased market access and opportunities for specialization in exchange for diminished space for use of industrial policy instruments to create new productive capacities. However, the trade-offs are intensified in the case of regional-bilateral agreements: countries receive more market access, but in exchange make significantly deeper concessions regarding the management of inward investment and intellectual policy. I argue that countries whose integration into the international economy is guided by their obligations as members of the {WTO} still have opportunities to implement industrial strategies that are designed to alter comparative advantages and achieve upward mobility in the international economic order, but the obligations under the regional-bilateral strategy greatly circumscribe these options. The paper thus points to the need for new terms of reference in the debate over 'policy space' in the international political economy. In analyzing contemporary development strategies, the most useful contrast is not between the alternatives that countries have under the {WTO} and the alternatives that countries had in the past under the {WTO}'s predecessors, but between a constraining multilateral environment and even more constraining regional and bilateral environments that condition increased market access on the sacrifice of the very tools that countries have historically used to capture the developmental benefits of integration into the international economy.},

In practice, these four dimensions of change interact and build on each other.

A dilemma at the heart of the {WTO} between two important goals of representativeness and effectiveness means that both goals cannot be pursued at the same time. Now, this inherent tension is being magnified by power shifts in the global economy most evident in the rise of emerging powers within the {WTO}, who demand more representation, and the retreat by the {US} towards a more inward-looking orientation; both together damage effectiveness. Simultaneously, new powers such as China and India are defending a 'reformed multilateralism' combined with selective protectionism with varying capacity. These shifts are transforming previous 'crises within institutions' into a 'crisis of institutions' at the {WTO}, wherein the rules of the game, ideas of free trade and the legitimacy of the {WTO} are under threat. Global trade politics is seeing new coalitions at the {WTO}, as emerging powers craft their own rise, {US} defends sovereignty and trade protections, and launches a challenge to China's rise, and some established powers (the {EU} for example) seek to reform it. The new global trade politics is walking on two uneven legs and creating winners and losers and new ways of managing the transitional trading order as did the creation of the post-world war order.},

In this article, however, I contest this assessment by arguing that the emerging powers were never solely, nor most importantly, merely an economic phenomenon. Instead, I show that emerging powers—specifically Brazil, India and China—have become an important political force in the global trading system and have had a profound and lasting impact on the World Trade Organization ({WTO}). Contrary to the widespread assumption that these countries are too diverse to ally, I argue that the emerging powers displayed a remarkable degree of unity and cooperation, working in close concert to successfully challenge the dominance of the {US} and other established powers. As evidenced by the collapse of the Doha Round, the collective rise of Brazil, India and China substantially disrupted the functioning of one of the core institutions of the liberal economic order created under {US} hegemony.},

Many of the {BRICS}' (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) dominance in export markets for low-skilled goods pose a particular challenge for “surplus-labor” countries characterized by large populations of unskilled and underemployed labor. We theorize the incentives of firms and governments in surplus-labor countries to form South-South preferential trade agreements ({SSPTAs}) as a means of diversifying and expanding trade relationships in the face of this challenge. Of all the {BRICS}, our findings show that China poses the greatest challenge; the countries forming the most South-South agreements are those whose exports have been most displaced by China. We verify this pattern using both systemic and country-specific measures of the China “shock.” Imports from China, in contrast, have no significant effect on {SSPTA} formation. Our account, which helps resolve the dual puzzle of declining trade with rich countries and the proliferation of {SSPTAs} in recent decades, underlines the implications of China's rise on the developing world.},

We use trade data analysis to explore the changing geography of global trade and to highlight the emergence of more polycentric trade. We argue that our understanding of {GVCs} and {GPNs}, in a context where Southern actors and Southern end markets have more prominent roles, requires greater attention to the existence of multiple value chains ({VCs}) and production networks ({PNs}) serving different end markets – including domestic, regional and global. Consequently, there is a need to refine our understanding of both governance dynamics – lead firm strategies and standards requirements – and upgrading prospects through recognizing this shifting trade geography. We conclude by raising several new research questions regarding the conceptualization of {VCs} and {PNs} in a world where Southern actors and Southern markets are increasingly important.},

This book tackles arguably the most perennial and deep-rooted of all questions in political economy, and questions the incumbent orthodox liberal theories of collective action. Using a historical institutionalist framework to explore and explain the political economy of trade protectionism and liberalization, this book is based on detailed case studies of the textiles and clothing sector in the {EU}, United States, China, Caribbean Basin and sub-Saharan Africa. From this, the book expands to discuss the origins of trade protectionism and examine the wider political effects of liberalization, offering an explanation of why a successful conclusion to the {WTO} 'Doha' round has proven to be so elusive. The book argues that the regulation of global trade - and the economic consequences that this has for both developed and developing countries - has been the result of the particular way in which trade preferences are mediated through political institutions. The Global Political Economy of Trade Protectionism and Liberalization will be of interest to those studying and researching international and comparative political economy, developing area studies, economics, law and geography.},

We find that deepened preferential trade liberalization has fostered a reshaping of manufacturing production structures according to regional comparative advantage in labor and skilled labor. Furthermore, declining internal tariffs have weakened agglomeration forces determined by the distribution of market sizes. By using {GMM} estimation techniques, we ensure that these results are robust to endogeneity and serial correlation.},

Trade agreements between developed and developing countries (North-South {PTAs}) tend to be characterized by great depth, such that they include chapters for many trade-related regulatory issues, including intellectual property, foreign investment, and investor-state dispute settlement, among other things. In this way, North-South {PTAs} are thought to be different from South-South {PTAs} (between developing countries), which are shallower and focus on removing traditional tariff barriers to trade, as opposed to tackling trade-related regulatory issues. However, some developing countries appear to prefer deeper trade agreements, which begs the questions: How deep are South-South {PTAs} and what explains the variation in their depth? We address these questions using statistical analysis and interviews with current and former trade officials from developing countries. Our findings show that developing countries form deep trade agreements with one another when both are parties to North-South {PTAs}, as each are familiar and comfortable with the sorts of provisions in deep agreements. Our findings suggest that the formation of deep trade agreements between developing countries reflects socialization into the liberal international order through policy learning.},

This article examines the North-South and South-South politics surrounding two efforts to operationalize this idea—the Protocol Relating to Trade Negotiations Among Developing Countries in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Global System of Trade Preferences Among Developing Countries within the {UN} Conference on Trade and Development. It argues that the rich world has been somewhat obstructive in these efforts, but ultimately the primary cause for the weakness of these agreements is traced to failure by the Global South to make good on the rhetoric surrounding economic cooperation and {SouthSouth} solidarity. Lessons from this history must be learned if current efforts to extend the {GSTP} are to bring greater benefits, particularly to the least developed.},

Unlike the case for North-South exchanges, academic work on South-South economic relations has been historically limited given their marginal importance in the global economy. After the 1990s, the literature has changed in two main ways. First, South-South trade and finance since then has increased dramatically, leading to a bourgeoning literature on the topic. Second, the rise of the Emerging South has opened up new lines of inquiry to include not just the traditional topics of trade and preferential trading agreements, but also cover technology transfer, capital flows, labor migration, institutions, and environment. We discuss how this literature has evolved to take into account the greater complexity of South-South relations with a focus on China in Africa as well as the blurring of the lines between heterodox and mainstream analysis of South-South relations. We end the review by showing how the empirical and theoretical literature is exploring the increasing divergence within the global South between what we refer to as the Emerging South and the Rest of South.},

Our study focuses on the welfare effects of {RTAs} (pertaining to trade creation and trade diversion) among this group of countries. We use a theoretically justified gravity model to estimate welfare effects, focusing on trade creation and trade diversion and deviating from the norm in related studies, accounting for heterogeneity in third countries. Using {ECOWAS} as a sample, we estimate welfare effects on 1992–2012 annual bilateral imports for 14 countries from 169 countries. Contrary to conventional expectations in the literature, we find that economic integration among small and relatively low-income countries that have a small share of total trade with each other is welfare-improving for the members as a group, for the majority of the individual member countries, and for some third countries. Accounting for heterogeneity in third countries reveals that an {RTA} among low-income countries has a particularly robust trade-creation effect.},

We study to what extent micro-level parameters can be recovered from gravity regressions estimated with aggregate data. We show that estimation of gravity equations in their original multiplicative form via Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood ({PPML}) is more robust to aggregation than estimation of log-linearized gravity equations via ordinary least squares ({OLS}). In the leading case where regressors do not vary at the micro level, {PPML} estimates obtained with aggregate data have a clear interpretation as trade-weighted averages of micro-level parameters that is not shared by {OLS} estimates. However, when regressors vary at the micro level, using disaggregated data is essential because in this case not even {PPML} can recover parameters of interest. We illustrate our results with an application to Baier and Bergstrand's (2007) influential study of the effects of trade agreements on trade flows. We examine how their findings change when estimation is performed at different levels of aggregation, and explore the consequences of aggregation for predicting the effects of trade agreements.},

Our discussion highlights the different ways that the {DiD} literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work.

These fixed effects capture the determinants of trade flows normally included in gravity model specifications and control for yearly shocks to countries' trade. Controlling for the fixed effects generally reduces the estimated trade impacts of regional agreements. The estimates reveal that regional agreements have significant anticipatory effects on trade flows and continue to affect trade for up to 11 years after they begin. The paper also presents estimated effects on individual countries' trade flows in year five of the agreements.},

This finding has been scrutinized and modified in subsequent research, using different datasets, econometric methods and separating the {WTO} from other forms of trade agreements. A key characteristic of this literature is the rather simplistic way in which trade agreements are treated whereby all trade agreements are lumped together. Trade agreements come, however, in many different forms and shapes. This paper addresses these differences in trade agreements. Using a unique database of 296 trade agreements, we distinguish 17 trade-related policy domains, 9 indicators of institutional quality and indicate whether the agreements contain legally enforceable commitments. This extensive and novel taxonomy of trade agreements enables us to allow for the possible heterogeneity of the impact of trade agreements on international trade. Using a gravity model, we find that trade agreement heterogeneity indeed matters for international trade, both positively and negatively.},

However, the gravity equation is subject to the same econometric critique as earlier cross-industry studies of U.S. tariff and nontariff barriers and U.S. multilateral imports: trade policy is not an exogenous variable. We address econometrically the endogeneity of {FTAs}. Although instrumental-variable and control-function approaches do not adjust for endogeneity well, a panel approach does. Accounting econometrically for the {FTA} variable's endogeneity yields striking empirical results: the effect of {FTAs} on trade flows is quintupled.

This puts pressure on the standard assumption that constant bilateral fixed effects are sufficient to control for unobserved heterogeneity. When looking across decades rather than years, changes in the economic landscape will affect both explanatory and dependent variables, thus biasing the results. The paper begins by providing evidence of time variation in the unobserved heterogeneity using a novel econometric test. It then presents a new way of estimating the gravity model that can identify and control for unobserved heterogeneity as it varies over country pairs and time. This approach substantially enhances the precision of the estimated parameters, enabling a detailed analysis of the impact of different types of economic integration agreements on trade on an annual basis. This heightened precision also demonstrates the diminishing importance of distance and allows our model to accurately depict the evolution of trade over time. The pattern in the unobserved heterogeneity closely resembles the ascent and the deceleration of globalization. The paper closes with some preliminary analysis into the factors that underlie the unobserved heterogeneity.},

First, recent studies focusing on precise and unbiased estimates of effects of economic integration agreements ({EIAs}) on members׳ trade may be biased upward owing to inadequate control for time-varying exogenous unobservable country-pair-specific changes in bilateral export costs (possibly decreasing the costs of international relative to intranational trade); we find evidence of this bias using a properly specified gravity equation. Second, our novel methodology yields statistically significant estimates of the declining effect of “international borders” on world trade, now accounting for endogenous {EIA} formations and unobserved country-pair heterogeneity in initial levels. Third, we confirm recent evidence providing a solution to the “distance-elasticity puzzle,” but show that these estimates of the declining effect of distance on international trade are biased upward by not accounting for endogenous {EIA} formations and unobserved country-pair heterogeneity. We conclude our study with numerical general equilibrium comparative statics illustrating a substantive difference on trade effects of {EIAs} with and without allowance for the declining effects of international borders on world trade.},

Findings Results for Machinery products suggest a potential to expand trade with existing Regional Trade Agreements ({RTAs}) in the American continent, and countries of the {IGAD} region in Africa. In Transportation, a high trade potential with {RTAs} is found in the Americas, Africa and the Middle East. Policy suggestions concentrate on opportunities for enhancing trade relations through trade liberalization and agreement proliferation. Originality/value There are no studies to date, that examine “collective” measure of {EU} trade potential, that treats the {EU} as a single country. Changes in existing opportunities to expand trade, common for {EU} members, are of special interest for policy formulation, especially after the recent turmoil presented by the Global Financial Crisis ({GFC}) and the Greek Economic Crisis ({GEC}). Treating the {EU} as a single entity, is necessary for the formulation of an effective, common, {EU} trade policy. This study concentrates on the manufacturing sector to examine existing opportunities for the {EU} to expand trade, after the {GFC} and the {GEC}. This article deals with Machinery ({HS} 84 and 85) and Transportation ({HS} 86 through 89) products as they comprise a significant part of total {EU} exports, reaching 41\% of total exports in 2016. Finally, this study offers a unique illustration of results through trade potential heat maps.},

We first identify 908 unique estimates of the effects of {FTAs} on different trading pairs for the years 1986–2006. We then employ these estimates as our dependent variable in a “second stage” analysis characterizing the heterogeneity in these effects. Interestingly, most of this heterogeneity (∼2/3) occurs within {FTAs} (rather than across different {FTAs}), with asymmetric effects within pairs (on exports vs. imports) also playing an important role. Our second stage analysis provides several intuitive explanations behind these variations. Even within the same agreement, {FTA} effects are weaker for more distant pairs and for pairs with otherwise high levels of ex ante trade frictions. The effects of new {FTAs} are similarly weaker for pairs with existing agreements already in place. In addition, we are able to relate asymmetries in {FTA} effects to each country's ability to influence the other's terms of trade. Out-of-sample predictions incorporating these insights enable us to predict direction-specific effects of future {FTAs} between any pair of countries. A simulation of the general equilibrium effects of {TTIP} demonstrates the significance of our methods.},

However, the gravity equation is subject to the same econometric critique as earlier cross-industry studies of U.S. tariff and nontariff barriers and U.S. multilateral imports: trade policy is not an exogenous variable. We address econometrically the endogeneity of {FTAs}. Although instrumental-variable and control-function approaches do not adjust for endogeneity well, a panel approach does. Accounting econometrically for the {FTA} variable's endogeneity yields striking empirical results: the effect of {FTAs} on trade flows is quintupled. We find that, on average, an {FTA} approximately doubles two members' bilateral trade after 10 years.},

Specifically, we argue that structural gravity estimations should be performed with data that include not only international trade flows but also intra-national trade flows. The use of intra-national sales allows identification of the effects of non-discriminatory trade policies on the importer side (e.g. most favored nation tariffs) and on the exporter side (e.g. export subsidies), even in the presence of exporter and importer fixed effects. An important byproduct of our approach is that it can be used to recover estimates of the export-supply elasticity and of the import-demand elasticity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques in the case of {MFN} tariffs and "Time to Export" as representative determinants of trade on the importer and on the exporter side, respectively. Our methods can be extended to quantify the impact on trade of any country-specific characteristics as well as any non-trade policies.},

First, recent studies focusing on precise and unbiased estimates of effects of economic integration agreements ({EIAs}) on members׳ trade may be biased upward owing to inadequate control for time-varying exogenous unobservable country-pair-specific changes in bilateral export costs (possibly decreasing the costs of international relative to intranational trade); we find evidence of this bias using a properly specified gravity equation. Second, our novel methodology yields statistically significant estimates of the declining effect of “international borders” on world trade, now accounting for endogenous {EIA} formations and unobserved country-pair heterogeneity in initial levels. Third, we confirm recent evidence providing a solution to the “distance-elasticity puzzle,” but show that these estimates of the declining effect of distance on international trade are biased upward by not accounting for endogenous {EIA} formations and unobserved country-pair heterogeneity. We conclude our study with numerical general equilibrium comparative statics illustrating a substantive difference on trade effects of {EIAs} with and without allowance for the declining effects of international borders on world trade.},

We bridge this gap by providing individual estimates for {EIAs} on world trade, while employing first-differencing techniques to correct for endogeneity bias and account for phase-in effects. Overall, {EIAs} promote trade by at most 50 \%. Surprisingly, more than half of the {EIAs} investigated have had no discernible impact on trade at all, while only about one quarter of the agreements are trade promoting. Characteristics of these agreements, such as their institutional quality, design, and their members' involvement in the World Trade Organisation, shed more light on how this variation can be understood.},

	abstract = {For over 40 years, the gravity equation has been a workhorse for cross-country empirical analyses of international trade flows and — in particular — the effects of free trade agreements ({FTAs}) on trade flows. However, the gravity equation is subject to the same econometric critique as earlier cross-industry studies of U.S. tariff and nontariff barriers and U.S. multilateral imports: trade policy is not an exogenous variable. We address econometrically the endogeneity of {FTAs}. Although instrumental-variable and control-function approaches do not adjust for endogeneity well, a panel approach does. Accounting econometrically for the {FTA} variable's endogeneity yields striking empirical results: the effect of {FTAs} on trade flows is quintupled. We find that, on average, an {FTA} approximately doubles two members' bilateral trade after 10 years.},

He shows that total trade between {PTA} partners is a poor proxy for preferential trade (trade in tariff lines where preferences are likely to matter): while the former amounted to one-third of global trade in 2000-02, the latter was between one-sixth and one-tenth of world trade. His gravity model estimates indicate that using total rather than preferential trade to assess the impact of {PTAs} leads to a significant downward bias in the {PTA} coefficient. The author finds that product exclusions and long phase-in periods significantly limit preferential trade, and their removal could more than double trade in tariff lines above 3 percent of most-favored-nation ({MFN}) duties. He also shows that the effects of {PTAs} on trade vary by type of agreement and are increasing in the incomes of {PTA} partners.},

Specifically, it estimates the impact of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ({COMESA}) on Uganda's imports between 1994 and 2003. Detailed import and tariff data at the 6-digit harmonized system level are used for more than 1,000 commodities. Based on a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, the paper finds that - in contrast to evidence from aggregate statistics - {COMESA}'s preferential tariff liberalization has not considerably increased Uganda's trade with member countries, on average across sectors. The effect, however, is heterogeneous across sectors. Finally, the paper finds no evidence of trade-diversion effects.},

Furthermore, these {RTAs} are dominated by countries with a small share of total exports destined for intraregional trade flows. Our study focuses on the welfare effects of {RTAs} (pertaining to trade creation and trade diversion) among this group of countries. We use a theoretically justified gravity model to estimate welfare effects, focusing on trade creation and trade diversion and deviating from the norm in related studies, accounting for heterogeneity in third countries. Using {ECOWAS} as a sample, we estimate welfare effects on 1992–2012 annual bilateral imports for 14 countries from 169 countries. Contrary to conventional expectations in the literature, we find that economic integration among small and relatively low-income countries that have a small share of total trade with each other is welfare-improving for the members as a group, for the majority of the individual member countries, and for some third countries. Accounting for heterogeneity in third countries reveals that an {RTA} among low-income countries has a particularly robust trade-creation effect.},

Using bilateral export flows, we not only confirm the positive association between a country’s average income and its export unit values, but further identify a heterogeneous relationship with income inequality: we find a greater income spread to be associated with higher export unit values in the case of poor countries only. These results are robust to the inclusion of controls for other determinants of export unit values, as well as to the use of alternative measures of income inequality and of the quality index. We finally discuss various theoretical rationalisations for this heterogeneous relationship between income inequality and the quality content of exports along the average income dimension, and show suggestive evidence that demand-side mechanisms can account for it, at least partly.},

First, across firms selling a given product, exporters that charge higher prices earn greater revenues in each destination, have bigger worldwide sales, and enter more markets.

Third, across destinations within a firm-product, firms set higher prices in richer, larger, bilaterally more distant and overall less remote countries. Fourth, across destinations within a firm-product, firms earn bigger revenues in markets where they set higher prices. Fifth, across firms within a product, exporters with more destinations offer a wider range of export prices. Finally, firms that export more, enter more markets, and offer a wider range of export prices pay a wider range of input prices and source inputs from more origin countries. We propose that trade models should incorporate two features to rationalize these patterns in the data: more successful exporters use higher quality inputs to produce higher quality goods (stylized facts 1 and 2), and firms vary the quality of their products across destinations by using inputs of different quality levels (stylized facts 3, 4, 5, and 6).},

This finding has been scrutinised and modified in subsequent research, using different data sets, econometric methods and separating the {WTO} from other forms of trade agreements. A key characteristic of the subsequent literature is the rather simplistic way in which trade agreements are treated whereby all trade agreements are lumped together. Trade agreements come, however, in many different forms and shapes. This study addresses these differences in trade agreements. Using a unique database of 296 trade agreements, we distinguish 17 trade-related policy domains and indicate whether the agreements contain legally enforceable commitments. This extensive and novel taxonomy of trade agreements enables us to allow for the possible heterogeneity of the impact of trade agreements on international trade. Using a gravity model, we find that trade agreement heterogeneity indeed matters for international trade and that countries experience significant trade increases due to comprehensive trade agreements even if not all participants are in the {WTO}.},

These relationships reflect not only the sorting of firms across markets, but also the within-firm variation of unit values across destinations. Within product categories, higher-productivity firms tend to ship greater quantities at higher prices to a given market, consistent with higher quality. In addition, firm productivity tends to magnify the positive effect of distance on within-product unit values, suggesting that high-productivity, high-quality firms are more able to serve difficult markets.},

	abstract = {The Linder hypothesis has attracted substantial empirical research over decades. However, the evidence has failed to provide consistent support for it. This paper explains the failure. Building a theoretical framework in which, as in Linder's theory, product quality plays the central role, I show that the Linder hypothesis is formally derived but holds only when formulated as a sector-level prediction. This prediction is then estimated using a sample of 64 countries in 1995. The results support the sectoral Linder hypothesis: controlling for the effect of intersectoral determinants of trade, countries of similar income per capita trade more intensely with one another.},

In this paper we document that the probability that a product is added to a country's export basket is, on average, 65\% larger if a neighboring country is a successful exporter of that same product. For existing products, growth of exports in a country is 1.5\% higher per annum if it has a neighbor with comparative advantage in these products. While these results could be driven by a common third factor that escapes our controls, they align with our expectations of the localized character of knowledge diffusion.},
