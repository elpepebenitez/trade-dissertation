PSEUDO Planning

I already have data for:
- Geographic classification of countries
- Historic income classification of countries
- All preferential trade agreements signed by all countries, and with which countries are these relationships
- Exports at 6-digit HS codes for all countries and its destination country

A first-order question for the analysis I want to do, is how should I classify "North" and "South" countries? 
    North US + Europpe? South everything else?  
    Should I classify by income level?
    Should I exclude small-island states?

What is it that I want to research?

1. Do SSPTAs have an impact? 
    The change in the number of individual products exported
    The change in the total value of individual products exported
    The change in the weight of individual products exported

5-year averages pre and post?
