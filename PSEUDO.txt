PSEUDO Planning

I already have data for:
- Geographic classification of countries
- Income classification of countries
- All preferential trade agreements signed by country
- All bilateral preferential trade relationships between countries
- Exports at 6-digit HS codes for all countries and its destination country

A first-order question for the analysis I want to do, is how should I classify "North" and "South" countries? 
    North US + Europpe? South everything else?  
    Should I classify by income level?
    Should I exclude small-island states?
